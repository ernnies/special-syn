# Synapse Roadmap

Welcome to the **Synapse Roadmap**, a visionary journey to transform healthcare into a decentralized, AI-powered public good using the 0G Modular Layer 1 blockchain. This roadmap outlines the evolution of Synapse from ideation to a global healthcare ecosystem. Let’s dive into the waves of innovation!

---

## Overview
Synapse leverages Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and 0G’s modular services (Chain, Storage, Compute, Data Availability) to create a secure platform for medical record management, AI diagnostics, and data sharing via Intelligent NFTs (INFTs). This roadmap is a creative blueprint to guide development, testing, deployment, and scaling.

---

## Wave 1: Ideation and Initial Development
**Launch Date**: August 2025  
**Objective**: Spark the vision and build a proof-of-concept demo to lay the foundation.

### Milestones
- **Idea Generation**: Conceptualized a decentralized healthcare app where patients own their data, providers gain AI insights, and INFTs ensure verifiability.
- **Demo Creation**: Developed a basic Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS, integrated 0G Chain for a smart contract to create INFTs, and stored encrypted sample data on 0G Storage.
- **Initial Testing**: Ran the demo on a local 0G node, ensuring wallet connectivity with RainbowKit.

### Illustration
```
   [Patient] --> [Wallet Login] --> [0G Chain: INFT Creation] --> [0G Storage: Encrypted Data]
          |                       |
          v                       v
    [Idea Spark]           [Demo Prototype]
```
- **Visual Description**: Imagine a patient stepping into a digital health portal, their journey marked by a glowing wallet icon leading to a blockchain node (0G Chain) minting an INFT, with data securely locked in a vault (0G Storage). The "Idea Spark" ignites the process, and the "Demo Prototype" emerges as a seedling of innovation.

## Wave 2: MVP Development
 
**Objective**: Evolve the demo into a minimum viable product (MVP) with functional AI and data-sharing capabilities.

### Milestones
- **AI Integration**: Deployed a diagnostic AI model on 0G Compute to analyze health data (e.g., predicting risks from vitals), accessible via a chat interface.
- **Data Sharing**: Enhanced the smart contract on 0G Chain to allow secure, temporary data access for providers, with 0G Data Availability ensuring real-time updates.
- **UI Enhancement**: Upgraded the frontend with a conversational UI, where users can ask, “What’s my health trend?” and receive visual responses.
- **Testing Phase**: Rigorously tested on the 0G testnet, optimizing compute costs and ensuring contract reliability.

### Illustration
```
   [User] --> [Chat UI] --> [0G Compute: AI Diagnostics] --> [Health Insight]
          |                       |                        |
          v                       v                        v
    [Wallet] --> [0G Chain: Share Permission] --> [0G DA: Real-Time Data]
```
- **Visual Description**: Picture a user engaging with a sleek chat window, their input flowing to 0G Compute where an AI brain analyzes data, delivering insights. Parallelly, their wallet unlocks a permission gate on 0G Chain, with 0G Data Availability acting as a live data stream, like a heartbeat monitor pulsing with information.

---

## Wave 3: Production-Ready Deployment
 
**Objective**: Launch a production-ready platform, inviting early adopters with a polished experience.

### Milestones
- **Live Deployment**: Released the app on Vercel, with smart contracts deployed to 0G mainnet, offering free credits to new users.
- **Feature Rollout**: Introduced a status dashboard to monitor 0G services, a chat panel for generating health charts (e.g., “Show my blood pressure trends”), and community sharing options.
- **Scalability**: Added multi-chain support (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon) and migrated APIs to a robust backend for production stability.
- **User Engagement**: Created a demo video showcasing a user generating a stable health metric chart, shared anonymously with the community.

### Illustration
```
   [User] --> [Wallet Login] --> [Status Dashboard] --> [Chat Panel: "Chart Request"]
          |                       |                        |
          v                       v                        v
    [Credits] --> [0G Mainnet] --> [0G Compute: Chart] --> [Community Share]
```
- **Visual Description**: Envision a user logging in with a glowing wallet, greeted by a control panel (Status Dashboard) showing 0G’s health. They request a chart via the Chat Panel, credits flow to 0G Mainnet, and 0G Compute crafts a visual, shared like a digital health bulletin board with the community.

## Wave 4: Scaling and Partnerships
 
**Objective**: Scale the platform globally and forge strategic partnerships to enhance its impact.

### Milestones
- **Traction Goal**: Aim for 100+ active users through free credit promotions and community outreach.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with healthcare organizations and AI providers to integrate specialized models and datasets.
- **Advanced Features**: Implement cross-chain interoperability, a mobile app for on-the-go access, and community-contributed AI tools for collaborative research.
- **Sustainability**: Introduce a token-based credit system for long-term funding and user engagement.

### Illustration
```
   [User Base] --> [Partnerships] --> [Cross-Chain Network] --> [Mobile App]
          |                       |                        |
          v                       v                        v
    [100+ Users] --> [AI Tools] --> [Token Economy] --> [Global Impact]
```
- **Visual Description**: Visualize a growing user base branching into partnerships, like roots of a tree, connecting to a cross-chain network (a web of blockchain nodes). A mobile app blooms as the fruit, supported by AI tools and a token economy, culminating in a globe symbolizing global healthcare transformation.
